<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Silent Voice</h3>
<p>This movie is a correct representation of emotions dealing with stress, depression, social anxiety and a movie showcasing a great romance.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>This is the best thriller movie that i have watched ever and probably has the most confusing ending to it.</p>
<h3>Wailing</h3>
<p>A South Korean thriller which is more horrifying than any of those cliche american horror movies out there and has the most scariest endings out there.</p>
